Compiling and running ctpd
==========================

ctpd is written in go (http://golang.org/).

Prerequisite
------------

To compile ctpd you'll need to:

* install go - see https://golang.org/doc/install

* install mongodb (https://www.mongodb.org/).


On Ubuntu, momgodb can be installed simply as follows:


    sudo apt-get install mongodb


From there, the simplest way to install ctpd is to run


    go get github.com/cloudsecurityalliance/ctpd 


This is all that is needed. With this solution "mgo" (see below) is installed automatically.

As an alternative, if you want to proceed "manually", you'll need to:

* install mgo, the "rich mongo driver for go" (see https://labix.org/mgo)


    go get gopkg.in/mgo.v2


* create the path `$GOPATH/src/github.com/cloudsecurityalliance/`

* run `git clone https://github.com/cloudsecurityalliance/ctpd.git` in the previously created directory.


Compiling and running
---------------------

To run ctpd directly, you can type `go run ctpd.go`.

To get more options, type `go run ctpd.go --help`
